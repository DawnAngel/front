This is an unordered & random future ideas to discuss. Once an idea is
discussed it should be moved as a task/issue to the backlog.

Current ideas:

##### Use Bootstrap or not?

Argh, its easy to work with, but every project built with it looks pretty
similar :(

So ... from scratch or modifiying Bootstrap?


##### Use Less or SAAS?

Which framework of CSS we should use? Come'on! I know I know, we said NO to
frameworks but hey! CSS is a pain in the ass and those two libraries are
very useful ;)
